# install rector globally
# --prefer-dist: This flag tells Composer to prefer installing the package from a pre-built distribution file (.phar or similar) if available. This can be faster than downloading the source code and compiling it.
# --no-progress: This flag suppresses the progress bar that Composer normally shows during installation.
# --classmap-authoritative: This flag tells Composer to trust the classmap file provided by the package instead of generating its own. This can be helpful if the package has specific requirements for how its classes are loaded.
